The following are some of the most used Core features:

- User to User and Group chat:
	- This is the most basic form of messaging which can exists between two individual users or users that are a part of a group. For a developer's perspective, the actual chat works using the following delivery methods:
	- On the message sender's side, the messages are sent using CometChat UI Kits which use SDKs which act as an API wrapper.
	- On the message receiver's side, the messages are delivered using a Websocket connection to the CometChat plaform which is managed by the SDKs.
	- For more details on Websockets and its connectivity details, please visit [Managing Web Sockets](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/sdk/javascript/managing-web-sockets-connections-manually) in the CometChat SDK.
	- By default, user and group messaging along with Web Socket implementation is available in the UI Kits.
- Media sharing:
	- Sharing files, videos and other media types are the key in today's messaging world. You can implement media messages using SDKs or UI Kits as well as use [Extensions](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/fundamentals/extensions-overview) for Gifs and Stickers.
	- By default, support for Media messages is available in the UI Kits.
- Message Delivery and Read receipts:
	- Message delivery receipts indicate that a message has reached the message receiver. Message read receipt indicates that the message has been read by the message receiver. CometChat supports the following features from a message delivery and read indicator perspective:
	- Mark up to a message as delivered.
	- Mark up to a message as read.
	- Mark all messages after a particular message as unread.
	- To view these features, please visit [Delivery and Read receipts](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/sdk/javascript/delivery-read-receipts#mark-messages-as-unread) in the SDK docs.
	- By default, support delivery and read receipts is available in the UI Kits.
- Typing indicators:
	- Typing indicators in a conversation provide an indication to other users that a given user is typing a message. To implement typing indicators, visit the [Typing indicators](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/sdk/javascript/typing-indicators) section of the SDK docs.
	- By default, support Typing indicators is available in the UI Kits.
- Mentions (@username):
	- Mentions allow users to refer to a specific user in a conversation. This is done by sending a '@username' in the message to address that user.
	- To implement Mentions, please visit [Mentions](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/sdk/javascript/mentions) section in the SDK docs.
	- By default, support for Mentions is available in the UI Kits.
- Reactions:
	- Reactions on a message allow users to express their emotions using emojis. To implement Reactions, please visit the [Reactions](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/sdk/javascript/reactions) section in the SDK docs.
	- By default, support for Reactions is available in the UI Kits.
- Threaded Conversations:
	- Message threads allow users to branch off a conversation specific to a topic within a conversation in a sub-conversation. Such a conversation is called a Threaded conversation. To implement Threads in a conversation, please visit [Threaded Messages](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/sdk/javascript/threaded-messages) section in the docs.
	- By default, support for Threaded conversations is available in the UI Kits.
