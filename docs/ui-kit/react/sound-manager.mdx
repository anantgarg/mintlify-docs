## Overview

The SoundManager is a helper class responsible for managing and playing various types of audio in the CometChat UI Kit. This includes sound events for incoming and outgoing calls.

## Methods

### Play Sound

`CometChatSoundManager.play` method plays the default audio resource for incoming & outgoing calls. It also allows for customisation of the audio resources. You can pass a mp3 file asset path of your choice.

### Pause Sound

The `CometChatSoundManager.pause` method pauses the currently playing sound in the CometChatSoundManager.

- `pause()`: This method pauses any sound currently being played.
